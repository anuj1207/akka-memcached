- Add snappy compression option

- Add a fronting cache - perhaps spray-caching would be decent here

- Mutli-get will be 'interesting' when we have consistent hashing
  - Normally you want to have a sequence of GETs (GETQs, perhaps followed by a
    final GET or NOOP) but that is desirable when you're going to the same
    server for all of them.
  - Consistent Hashing will throw a wrench into the works due to the fact that
    the 'keys' being retrieved will be on many different servers.
  - Perhaps what needs to be done is to using the hashing algorithm to grab all
    of the key/host pairs that need to be pulled, and then batch them up per
    server.
  - However, this still needs to be made coherent with the user.  The API can't
    know that this is going on - i.e. all of the results need to look like they
    came from a single endpoint.

- Need read / write throttling
